# DNS Tunneling

The DNS system is one of the major parts of the Internet. Without DNS - the average person could not access any website that he wants, because who the hell remembers websites IP addresses...

Therefore no Firewall will block DNS packets.

So why not try to exploit of that?!

That what DNS Tunneling vulnerability do! DNS Tunneling is a cyber attack that encodes and hides data in seemingly legitimate DNS queries and responses.

In this repo you will find our implementation.
